2. Grant of Rights
------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    to reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense, and distribute
    the Modifications created by such Contributor either on an unmodified
    basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part
    of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either on an
    unmodified basis or as part of Modifications.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes or makes the Contribution available to the public.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its
    Contributor Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any licenses to the intellectual property of
any Contributor except as expressly stated in this Section 2. No
Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

After You obtain Covered Software, You may choose to distribute the
Covered Software under a subsequent version of the License (if one is
available) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under
the terms of Section 3.3). If the Covered Software was distributed under
the terms of version 1.1 or earlier of the License, You may also choose
to distribute it under the terms of a Secondary License, if the
Contributor has attached the notice described in Exhibit B to the
Covered Software.

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes the
Contribution was created in a way that is compliant with applicable
laws related to software development, including applicable patent and
copyright laws, and that the Contribution is not believed to infringe
any patent or copyright.

2.6. Fair Use

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trade
marks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor and its
affiliates, except as required to comply with Section 4(c) of the
License and to reproduce the content of the NOTICE file.

3. Conditions and Limitations
------------------------------

3.1. Conditions

You must ensure that all Modified Files include any changes needed to
run those files on hardware for which the Covered Software is intended.
You must ensure that all Executable Form files include any changes needed
to run those files on hardware for which the Covered Software is

3.2. Additional Terms

(a) All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form,
    including any Modifications that You create or to which You
    contribute, must contain a file at the top level called LICENSE.
    This LICENSE file must contain the text of this License verbatim,
    without modification.  You may add additional licenses after the
    NOTICE file, but You may not modify the text of the NOTICE file.

(b) You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to
    contain a file documentation of the changes You made to create that
    Covered Software and the date of any change. You must make that file
    contain a description of the changes and the name, email address, and
    (optional) postal address of the Contributor. You must also require
    that all such changes be subject to the Conditions of this License.

(c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files and the date of any change.

(d) You must cause all Covered Software that You distribute or
    otherwise make available to be licensed under the terms of this
    License, including any Contributions obtained from that Covered
    Software.

(e) The licenses granted in Section 2 of this License must be
    subordinate to the terms of this License.

3.3. Availability of Source Code

Any Executable Form of the Covered Software and its dependencies,
including any Modified Versions, must also include the Source Code Form
of the same.

3.4. Description of Modifications

You must cause any Modified Versions of the Covered Software to carry
prominent notices stating that it has been modified.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to distribute Covered Software under a Secondary License,
such that the additional rights granted under such Secondary License
are in addition to (and not in place of) the rights granted under this
License.

4. Verbatim Copies of this License
----------------------------------

You must include a copy of this License & the list of conditions and
limitation between the document.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing.

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
---------------------------

<|cursor|>
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including,
without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
resulting from such party's gross negligence to the extent applicable
law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

7. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"
and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used
in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights
set forth herein.

8. MISCELLANEOUS

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

9. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS

Except as required in Section 4(b) and as required to obtain patents,
each Contributor must defend and indemnify the other Contributors
("Indemnified Contributors") against any claim, demand, suit, or
proceeding arising out of, or directly or indirectly related to, a
Contribution or Covered Software from such Contributor. The defense and
indemnification obligations under this Section 9 are incurred to the
extent allowed under applicable law.
